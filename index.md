# North Dakota Building Codes

North Dakota is a home rule state, meaning that certain municipalities have been granted the authority to pass their own laws and collect taxes. In North Dakota, if a city chooses to adopt building codes, it must adopt the State Building Code, but can make amendments as needed. Designated home rule cities, on the other hand, may adopt something other than the State Building Code.

Find more information about building codes and home rule at the [State Department of Commerce website](https://www.commerce.nd.gov/community-services/building-codes).

Below is a map showcasing the adopted building codes in cities with larger populations and/or moderate to high permit activity.
