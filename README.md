# North Dakota Building Codes - Map

This repository has been created for hosting an interactive map created with qgis2web plugin. 

Followed the tutorial by [GispoCoding](https://github.com/GispoCoding/demo_map) at this [blog](https://www.gispo.fi/en/blog/why-you-should-use-qgis2web-plugin-github-pages-to-produce-interactive-maps/)

This map displays information on building codes across North Dakota and other relevant information. 

## Data Sources
I utilized OpenStreetMap and Census data to build the map. Internal information came from government websites, the US Census, and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
